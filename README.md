# austincodez
This is my current portfolio site. It's currently live at austincodez.dev! 
This was originally a project from the Scrimba.com Frontend Developer Career Path. 

# Upgrades coming
Hoping to get a modified verision of this site up soon using React. I am also hoping to use Gatsby JS, add a coffee blog(what am I currently drinking), and even a contact form. 
Stay tuned for more updates soon!
